Project 4 - Game Show App Using Object-Oriented Programming 

The goal of the game is to correctly guess the phrase before you run out of hearts. Every time you guess an incorrect letter you lose a heart.

Phrases are generated randomly so if you are presented with a phrase you have already encountered, simply click on the "Skip This Phrase" button to generate a new phrase.

If you are stuck and don't know what the phrase could be, you can click on the "Hint" button to reveal a hint. However, if you click on the hint button you will lose one heart. And because of this, once you only have one heart left, the hint button will be disabled because at that stage using it will automatically make you lose the game. 

For the style changes for exceeds instead of making a lot changes to the original styles.css file, I chose to create a new style sheet with a totally different color scheme and give the user the option between the two color modes (one light, the original css file, and one dark, the css file I created). At any point in the game the user can click on the dark or light mode button to change the game's color scheme. (The only change I made to the original css file was to the colors of the onscreen keyboard keys when clicked-they turn a soft red color for wrong guesses and a soft green color for correct guesses). 

For exceeds, I also enabled the game to be played from the user's computer keyboard in addition to the onscreen keyboard. The Start Game button can also be "clicked" on by pressing the return key on the user's computer keyboard.
